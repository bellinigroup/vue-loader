# vue-loader

This repository is a complete fork of [vue-loader](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader) with altered script sourcemap generation logic. In this version sourcemaps are generated for isolated scripts instead of full component files.

For documentation see original [readme](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader).
